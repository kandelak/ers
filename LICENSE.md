- This codebase is simply a python binding implementation of the ERS (Entropy Rate Superpixel Segmentation)
  algorithm implemented here: https://github.com/davidstutz/superpixels-revisited/tree/master
- I have done nothing but adapt that implementation for easy-to-use python bindings.
- License for this adapted implementation is the same as the original implementation.
